### Hi there 👋

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **React/React Native Community**
- 💅 Designed: [Resume Builder](https://jakemadash.github.io/resume/), [Pop Shop](https://jakemadash.github.io/shop/), [Vocabulate](https://jakemadash.github.io/vocabulate/), and more!
- 💬 Ping me about **react**, **react native**, **tailwind**, **accessibility**
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I wrote, recorded, and produced my own EP, which you can check out [here!](https://soundcloud.com/darpersen/sets/a-fine-collection)
