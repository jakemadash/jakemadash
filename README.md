### Hi there 👋

#### I'm a Full-Stack Developer who loves music, reading, and language.

- 🏢 I'm currently working at **The Odin Project**
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.svg`
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **React Community**
- 💅 Designed: [Resume Builder](https://jakemadash.github.io/resume/), [Vocabulate](https://jakemadash.github.io/vocabulate/), and more!
- 💬 Ping me about **design**, **accessibility**, **react**, **development**
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I wrote, recorded, and produced my own EP, which you can check out [here!](https://soundcloud.com/darpersen/sets/a-fine-collection)
